# .NET Conf Calendar [![tests](https://github.com/jsakamoto/dotnetconf-calendar/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jsakamoto/dotnetconf-calendar/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

Exposing the session schedules of [.NET Conf](https://www.dotnetconf.net/) as iCal calendar feed.

## Usage

You can subscribe to the calendar feed by using the following URL:

```
https://dotnetconf-calendar.azurewebsites.net/ical/v1
```

## How it works

This is a simple [ASP.NET Web API](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/apis) application on **.NET 9**. The calendar feed is generated by scraping the session schedules from the [.NET Conf's Agenda page](https://www.dotnetconf.net/agenda). The scraping is done by using [AngleSharp](https://anglesharp.github.io/) and the calendar feed is generated by using [Ical.Net](https://github.com/rianjs/ical.net). The calendar feed is hosted on [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/).
